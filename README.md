Apnea Classification Using Deep Learning

Deep-learning models for detecting sleep apnea events from audio and PSG-derived features.

This project implements a complete pipeline for sleep apnea classification using audio-based features such as log-Mel spectrograms or MFCCs.
It is designed to be modular, easy to extend, and optimized for both CNN and RNN training workflows.

The goals of this project are:

Convert raw audio into time–frequency representations.

Build patient-based datasets with correct train/val/test splitting.

Train deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM, etc.) for multi-class apnea classification.

Save processed data to speed up future training and experimentation.
